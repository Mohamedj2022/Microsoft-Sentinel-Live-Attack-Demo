<h1>Microsoft Sentinel Live Attack Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<b>I documented my experience of utilizing Microsoft Azure to create a virtual machine on the cloud, running Windows 10. To make this VM accessible via the internet, I employed Azure Log Analytics Workspace, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and Azure Sentinel to collect and aggregate attack data. The attack data was then displayed on a map using Microsoft Sentinel. Throughout this project, I utilized various tools and resources, including PowerShell. Specifically, I employed PowerShell to scan the Event Viewer in the exposed VM, focusing on EventID 4625 (failed logon attempts). The PowerShell script sent this data to a logfile and also transmitted the IP addresses of failed logons to IPgeolocation.io through an API. This information could then be utilized to map the origin of logon attempts in Microsoft Sentinel. This project allowed me to gain experience with cloud resources and concepts, APIs, SIEMs, and Microsoft Azure. I learned a great deal about configuring and provisioning resources in the cloud and analyzing SIEM logs. Overall, this project was an enjoyable and rewarding experience, and I hope that readers can appreciate the work that was involved.<b/>

<b>To begin, I will establish a Microsoft Azure account to serve as my cloud environment for provisioning resources. For this project, I will make use of the $200 credit that I will receive. As the resources I require are not particularly resource-intensive, I can allocate any remaining credit towards future projects. Additionally, I will use a specific website for my IP geolocation data. </b> <br/>

<b>The next thing I'll do is start the process of creating my virtual machines. Provisioning a VM can be a lengthy process so while I move on to the next step, my VM can be provisioned in the background.</b> <br/>
</p>

<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
<b>During the VM provisioning process, it is essential to create a new Resource Group that will encompass all my future resources. In Azure, a resource group is a logical collection of configurations, services, tools, and other resources that fall under a common umbrella. By grouping them together, they can be created and deleted together, as they share the same lifespan. If some resources exist outside a particular resource group and I delete that group, the resources outside of it will remain unaffected. Thus, managing resources becomes more convenient when they are in one place. For this project, I have chosen to name my resource group "HoneyPot_Lab" and my virtual machine "HoneyPot-VM".</b>

<br />
<p align="center">
<b>Next, I navigated to the same page and selected the VM size that I wanted to provision. Initially, I chose Standard_B1s, as indicated by the green circle in the photo. However, I later decided to upgrade to Standard_B2s, which offered two CPU cores and more RAM, as the initial choice was too slow. The VM was lagging, and PowerShell kept crashing. After selecting the appropriate VM size, I created the admin account. I selected a unique admin name and generated a 30-character password comprising special characters, numbers, and a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters. Since I anticipated brute force and dictionary attacks aimed at logging into the exposed VM, a strong password was essential. At this stage, I set the public inbound port rules, essentially determining which ports would be open to connect to the VM. While multiple authentication methods, such as SSH, were available, I chose to allow only RDP, which operates on port 3389.</b> <br/>

<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
<b>The subsequent step is to generate a new Network Security Group (NSG), which acts as a firewall that can generate and enforce inbound and outbound traffic regulations to Azure resources. However, for this project, we do not require any traffic regulations. We intend to allow everyone and anyone to communicate with the honeypot VM. Although there exists a default inbound rule, we will eliminate it and introduce a new inbound rule that permits EVERYTHING into the VM. In the Destination Port Ranges box, I inserted an asterisk (*) to denote Anything. This step permits all port ranges and protocols. For Priority, I designated it as 100 since the lower the number, the higher the priority. This rule will be prioritized over any rogue rule that may exist. With these settings, all traffic can pass through into our VM. However, it is critical to note that I would never implement this in an actual production environment.</b> <br/>

<b>Once I successfully log into the VM via RDP, I access the Event Viewer which logs every activity that occurs in a Windows system. Each action is assigned an EventID for ease of navigation. For this project, I'm interested in monitoring EventID 4625, which tracks Failed Logon Attempts. To view these logs, I navigate to the Security tab. In the images below, I initiate another RDP session and attempt to log in with an incorrect password. This results in a failed logon attempt that is recorded and logged in Event Viewer.</b> <br/>

<br />
<p align="center">
<b>The next step is the ping the VM from my native computer. I do this to see if I can make a direct connection to the VM and see if it is currently discoverable. It is not. That is because the VM has Windows Defender Firewall activated. The firewall is blocking ICMP Echo Requests, making the VM undiscoverable. I know this because I pinged the VM's public IP address which is 74.235.173.155 and I see Request timed out a few times. The firewall is dropping the ICMP request packets.</b> <br/>

<b>With the VM now exposed to the internet, I can proceed with setting up the PowerShell script which is at the core of this project. This script has the ability to parse Event Viewer and look for EventID 4625. Upon finding such events, it extracts the IP address associated with the failed logon attempt and uses an API to send it to IPgeolocation.io for geolocation data retrieval. This was necessary because the IP address alone in event viewer does not include any geographical location. Instead of building a solution from scratch, I chose to use a system that is dedicated to retrieving and sending back geolocation data. The PowerShell script then collects all the geographical data and saves it as a string in a logfile called failed_rdp.log. I will later use this logfile in conjunction with Microsoft Sentinel to map attacks live.</b> <br/>

<b>Once I open PowerShell, I copy and paste the script that was prepared before the start of the project. Then, I save the script on the desktop as "Log_Exporter". At this point, it is recommended to create a profile on IpGeolocation to obtain an API key. The API key should be pasted into the PowerShell script. It is important to note that the free API calls are limited to 1000, so it's advisable to turn on the Windows Firewall settings until the setup of Log Analytics Workbooks Custom Fields is completed.

<b>At this point, another failed logon attempt was intentionally made to test the functionality of the PowerShell script. The log showed that the VM was being targeted by someone attempting to brute force it from Tunisia. Despite the potential risks, the data from this attack was valuable for training the AI in Azure. However, the free API from IPgeolocation.io only provided 1000 calls, which were quickly used up by the attacker from Tunisia.

<b>In order to create the map, a query needs to be added to the workbook. The query will specify the dataset to be used by Microsoft Sentinel by pointing out the necessary fields from Log Analytics.

<br />
<p align="center">
<b>Once the data points were queried, the next step was to choose how to visualize them. In this case, a map was selected. The map was configured to plot the attacks by latitude and longitude, rather than by country due to some of the attacks not including the country information. The metric settings were adjusted to make the bubbles larger based on event counts, so the larger the number of events, the larger the bubble. Once the settings were applied, the map was complete!</b>  <br/>

<b>It's impressive how quickly the attacks piled up, with a total of 10,529 failed login attempts recorded before the project was stopped. Only a small fraction of those attempts were from the USA, with the majority coming from Tunisia and Cambodia. It's clear that the attackers were using automated brute-forcing software to try different password combinations and usernames. This emphasizes the importance of using strong passwords and unique usernames to minimize the risk of successful attacks.

<h2 align="center">Decided To Run The Lab Again.</h2>
</p>

<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
<b>I opted to repeat the lab experiment, with the intention of allowing attackers more time to target the exposed VM, in the hopes of showcasing a greater variety of locations on the world map. My strategy proved successful, as this time a wider range of threat actors targeted the VM, resulting in a more diverse and detailed world map. I was happier with the outcome as more data was gathered.</b>  <br/>
</p>

<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
<b>During my second attempt at the lab, I encountered an issue where my PowerShell script would intermittently stop updating. Even though the script was still running, no new entries were being generated for 5 to 15 minutes. I found this to be odd, given that I knew there were many different countries attempting to brute-force their way into the VM, so there should have been a consistent flow of new entries. Moreover, I had set the refresh rate in the PS script to 300 milliseconds, down from 1 second in my earlier attempt. To understand the root cause of this issue, I decided to investigate further. As a first step, I wrote queries in Log Analytics Workbook to compare the number of security events with Event ID = 4625 against the number of Failed_RDP_Custom_Log’s generated.</b>  <br/>
</p>

![Security_Event_ID](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108043108/226673169-7b2f64a3-7ab1-4918-98e8-b680a553aabf.jpg)
<p align="center"><i>After writing my query we can see here that there was a total of 9282 EventID 4625 Security Events. This means that threat actors attempted to log into my VM 9282 times.</i></p>  <br/>

![Failed_RDP_Log](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108043108/226673194-787f3452-309d-4d0b-a375-c653fb16c4b1.JPG)
<p align="center">
<i>After writing this query we can see it returned a total of 3892 records, which means that my Custom Log only captured 3892 login attempts. Quite a bit away from 9282.</i>
</p>

<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
<b>Upon noticing a discrepancy between the number of security events and the custom log entries, I decided to investigate the issue. After comparing the numbers and finding them to be significantly different, I looked at my API usage for the day and found it to be much closer to the number of custom log entries. Based on this, I concluded that the issue was not with my VM failing to send data to the custom log.</b>  <br/>

<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
<b>Lastly, I chose to go into Microsoft Sentinel and see what the dashboard is showing. My PowerShell Script was still running in the background so the numbers aren't an exact match because these screenshots were taken a few minutes apart. Again, it is showing a number (4,100) that is much closer to the FAILED_RDP_CUSTOM_LOG query.</b>  <br/>

<br />
<br />
<h2 align="center">Conclusions</h2>

<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
<b>What I believe is occurring is that the Windows Event Viewer is functioning correctly. It is properly logging ALL login attempts and displaying the actual number of attempts that have occurred. The weak point in this issue is the PowerShell script. The reason why my PowerShell script was stopping for lengthy periods is due to being overwhelmed. Despite setting the refresh rate to 300 Milliseconds, the number of login attempts from several different attackers was significantly more than 1 attempt per 300 Milliseconds. My PowerShell script was the bottleneck. If it could capture each attempt as it occurred, it would show the actual number of attempts and be consistent with the Event Viewer. However, it could only capture 1 attempt per 300 Milliseconds, leading to some login attempts being lost or postponed (although I doubt it was postponed), resulting in the difference we are seeing. In the future, I may consider lowering the refresh rate even more to allow for more login attempts to be recorded.</b>  <br/>
</p>


<h2>There are several steps that can be taken to improve the Sentinel home lab:</h2>

<p> 
Optimize PowerShell script: One way to improve the PowerShell script is to optimize it so that it can handle a larger number of login attempts. This can be achieved by reducing the refresh rate, improving the code efficiency, and using multithreading to handle multiple connections at once.

Expand data collection: In addition to collecting login data, it may be useful to collect other types of data, such as firewall logs, network traffic data, and application logs. This can provide a more complete picture of the activity on the VM and help identify potential threats.

Configure alerts and notifications: Setting up alerts and notifications can help identify potential threats in real-time. This can be done by configuring alerts in Sentinel for specific events or by integrating Sentinel with other security tools.

Implement threat intelligence: Incorporating threat intelligence feeds can help identify known malicious IP addresses and other indicators of compromise. This can help prioritize and streamline the investigation process.

Regularly review and analyze data: It is important to regularly review and analyze the collected data to identify patterns and potential threats. This can be done by using machine learning and other advanced analytics tools.

Continuously update and improve the lab: Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, so it is important to continuously update and improve the Sentinel home lab to stay ahead of potential threats.</p>
